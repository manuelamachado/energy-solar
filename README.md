## UC Berkeley Analytics Project

**Name**  Forecast of Renewable Energy Consumption
Insight into Solar - Exploration into Monthly Solar Energy using four distinct techniques:
Autoregression, Linear Regression, Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor


**Motivation**: The world of solar has advanced dramatically, solarâ€™s clean energy is becoming more accessible every day. High residential electricity costs prompt homeowners to turn to solar for financial savings and environmental benefits. These trends motivated us to take a closer look at residential solar energy consumption in the United States.

**Data Source:**
- Solar Energy Consumption by the residential sector from U.S. Energy Information Administration (https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/browser/)
- Average Retail Price of Residential Electricity from U.S. Energy Information Administration (https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/browser/?tbl=T09.08#/?f=M)
- Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index (REDTI) from NOAA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/societal-impacts/redti/USA)

**Technology stack used:**
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels, plotly
- Flask, Html-css, bootstrap, bootswatch, Javascript, Jsonify
